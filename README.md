## üöÄ Project Overview

This project dives into advanced machine learning techniques and meticulous feature engineering to solve the Spaceship Titanic problem. Here are some highlights:

- **State-of-the-Art Models:**  
  Experimented with leading models like **XGBoost**, **LightGBM**, and **CatBoost**.
- **Winning Strategy:**  
  The combination of careful feature engineering and a vanilla **CatBoost** model achieved a top **3.4%** ranking with an accuracy of **80.9%**.
- **In-depth Analysis:**  
  Comprehensive data exploration, model tuning, and validation to ensure robustness.
